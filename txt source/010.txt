For the purposes of adjusting rents under the provisions of paragraph b. of this subsection, the Board may promulgate a schedule of standard rental increases or decreases for improvement or deterioration of specific housing services.	e.	Denial of Adjustment. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection, the Board may deny or refuse to grant any upward adjustment of the maximum rent for a controlled housing accommodation, if, upon petition of the tenant, it determines that the affected controlled housing accommodation does not comply with Article II of the State Sanitary Code or the State Building Code or the Boston Fire Prevention Code or any other applicable municipal code, ordinance, or State law, regulating the conditions or occupancy of housing accommodations. The Board may refuse to make a downward adjustment of the maximum rent for a controlled housing accommodation if it determines that the tenant is more than sixty (60) days in arrears in tendering rent for such housing accommodation, unless such arrearage is due to a withholding of rent pursuant to the provisions of Section 127L of Chapter 111 or Section 8A of Chapter 239 of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. For the purposes of this paragraph, an inspection report of a Board inspector or of any authorized State or City inspector or investigator shall be prima facie evidence that the conditions or lack of compliance reported exists.	f.	The Board may remove maximum rent levels established pursuant to subsections 10-2.4, 10-2.5 or 10-2.7, for any class of controlled housing 
accommodations if, in its judgment the need for continuing such maximum rental levels no longer exists because of sufficient construction of new housing accommodations, the rental levels for which are comparable to the rental levels of the class of controlled housing accommodations for which the maximum rental levels are to be discontinued or because the demand for housing accommodations has otherwise been met. Any maximum rental level removed pursuant to this paragraph shall be reimposed or adjusted and reimposed upon a finding by the Board that a substantial shortage of housing accommodations exist and that such reimposition is necessary to serve the public interest. Any action under this paragraph shall be subject to the hearing and notice requirements of paragraph b. of subsection 10-2.7.(Ord. 1972 c. 19; Ord. 1974 c. 13; CBC 1975 Ord.

For the purpose of preventing rent gouging, all other tenants of decontrolled housing may petition the Board on a form approved by the Administrator for a downward adjustment of the rent for such housing accommodation if the landlord has increased the rent for said tenant's housing accommodation by a percentage greater than ten (10%) percent in any one year. The Board shall, at least annually, take all reasonable steps to make such tenant aware of the provisions of this subsection and the rights and protections of all tenants existing pursuant to this section.

Administrator's recommendation; provided, however, such action shall occur within sixty (60) days after the Board's receipt of a petition. Until a decision has been made by the Board in favor of the tenant, the tenant shall be obligated to tender such rent increase as lawfully required by the landlord; provided, however, the Board shall order repayment. The Board may by regulation modify the hearing procedure provided for in this section to serve the public interest.	Any such petition shall be filed with the Board within forty-five (45) days after the tenant's receipt of the landlord's notice of the rent increase; provided, however, the Board may extend such period for filing if the tenant was unable to file the petition due to illness, absence from the City, or other good cause. The Administrator shall notify the landlord upon receipt of a petition. Failure on the part of the landlord to appear at a hearing, either in person or through counsel, on a tenant's petition pursuant to this subsection shall result in an automatic approval of said tenant's petition.	Within forty-five (45) days after the effective date of this section, annually on the second day of January, beginning in 1985, and as part of any notice of an increase in the rent for any decontrolled housing accommodation, and upon a tenant's initial taking of occupancy in a unit of a housing accommodation, every tenant shall be notified in writing of his right to file a rent grievance with the Board pursuant to this subsection.

Upon expiration of the applicable notice period as provided herein, the landlord must prove proof to the Court hearing any summary process action that he has complied with the provisions of this section with respect to recovery of a housing accommodation in order to proceed with a condominium or cooperative conversion eviction.

An eviction shall be presumed to be a condominium or cooperative conversion eviction if the landlord has the intent to convert, as defined herein.		3.	A landlord may seek to recover possession of a housing accommodation which has already been converted to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership for just cause other than a condominium or cooperative conversion eviction. The landlord must allege such just cause as part of the notice of termination of tenancy given to the tenant and as part of the summary process 
summons and complaint. The landlord shall give notice of the commencement of such summary process action to the Center at the same time the action is entered in court, together with a copy of the notice of termination of tenancy and summary process complaint.

Eviction. Eviction of tenants from controlled or decontrolled housing accommodations is governed by subsection 10-2.9 as modified by subsections 10-2.10 and 10-2.11.

Such recording shall be prima facie evidence of this exception notwithstanding any error or omission in regard thereto, and the Board shall have no authority to issue, and shall not issue, any certificate with regard to this exception.		1.	Sale or Transfer After Removal. Once a removal permit has been issued, no additional removal permit is required for subsequent transfers of ownership; provided, however, that all subsequent owners shall be subject to the terms of this section and to the effective terms and conditions of any previously issued removal permit.	e.	Removal Procedure.		1.	Generally. A separate removal permit shall be issued for each qualifying housing accommodation. Copies thereof shall be kept on file at the Board and certified copies shall be available upon payment of a reasonable fee.
		2.	Criteria. In reviewing an application for a removal permit the Board shall consider relevant factors including, without limitation; the aggravation of the shortage of safe, decent and affordable housing accommodations in the City and its neighborhoods which may result from the removal, especially for tenants of low and moderate income, and handicapped or elderly tenants. In making such determination the Board shall review and make findings as to all relevant factors including, without limitation, the following:			(a)	The benefits and detriments to the persons whom this section and this subsection seek to protect;			(b)	The hardships imposed on the tenant(s) residing in the housing accommodation proposed to be removed;			(c)	Circumstances demonstrating hardship and inequity to the applicant seeking a removal permit;			(d)	The rate of vacancy in the City of Boston at the time the applicant applies for a removal permit.			(e)	Substantiated evidence demonstrating the occurrence at the site of the housing accommodation of arson or a suspicious fire, as defined in subsection 10-2.15.		3.

All units in a building or project shall be offered for sale to the residing tenants at the same time, at the same or comparable price.		4.	Conditions to be Imposed on Removal Permits. The Board shall impose the following conditions, if applicable, when it grants a removal permit. Nothing in this section shall restrict an owner from conveying his/her interest in any building or property or portion thereof provided that the property shall remain subject to the provisions of this section and to the conditions and terms of the last issued removal permit. Once issued, a removal permit shall not be revoked; however, the Board may subsequently modify the terms of a removal permit in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph e, 5(a)-(c) of this subsection, and may take such action as is necessary to enforce the terms of the removal permit, as provided in paragraph f. of this subsection.			(a)	Right Of First Refusal to Purchase. Any tenant who lives in a housing accommodation for which a removal permit has been granted shall, within sixty (60) days of the date of the grant of the permit or such other time period as shall be established by the Board, be given the right of first refusal to purchase the housing accommodation he/she occupies for substantially the same or more favorable terms and conditions as are being or would be offered to prospective arms length purchasers.	Such tenant may exercise a right of first refusal to purchase such housing accommodation by executing a purchase and sales agreement prior to the expiration of ninety (90) days after the date of receiving a copy of the purchase and sales agreement properly executed by the person offering the housing accommodation for sale. Each time the housing is subsequently offered for sale, the tenant then occupying the housing accommodation shall be offered the right of first refusal to purchase as described above in this section.
			(b)	Code Compliance. At the time that a removal permit is granted the building must be in, and thereafter, remain in, full compliance with Article II of the State Sanitary Code, the State Building Code, the Boston Fire Prevention Code and any other applicable municipal code, ordinance, or state law, regulating the conditions or occupancy of housing accommodations. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if, for good cause, the building is not currently in compliance with any of the above codes, ordinances, or laws, the removal permit must be conditioned upon the applicant's agreement to bring the building and/or unit into such compliance within a specific time period determined reasonable by the applicable enforcement agency.			(c)	Maintenance and Repairs. Whenever the housing accommodation is used for rental housing purposes, the owner must designate a person or persons within twenty-five (25) miles of the building to be responsible for maintenance and repairs. The tenant in each unit shall be informed by the owner or his/her agent in writing as to who is responsible for maintenance and repairs, both as to common and individual unit areas, and such notice shall be updated whenever there is a change in tenants or a change in who is responsible for such maintenance:			(d)	Rent and Eviction Protections. The granting of a removal permit under this subsection shall not by itself operate to change the classification of the housing accommodation of controlled or vacancy decontrolled and the provisions of this section as the decontrol under paragraph e. of the definition of “housing accommodation” in subsection 10-2.1 shall continue to be in full force and effect. Nothing herein, however, shall extinguish the right of a landlord after the granting of a removal permit to seek decontrol status of a housing accommodation which is voluntarily vacated within the meaning of said paragraph e. of the definition of “housing accommodation” in subsection 10-2.1.		5.	Procedures.			(a)	The Board shall consider an application for a removal permit for a controlled or decontrolled housing accommodation, or an application to modify the terms of a removal permit previously issued, upon receipt of an application filed by the landlord, owner or other authorized person.

The Administrator may designate a person or persons to participate in a removal proceeding, where appropriate, in order to further the provisions and purposes of this section and to serve the public interest.			(b)	Removal permit hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of Chapter 30A of the General Laws except that requirements (7) and (8) of such Section 11 shall not apply to such hearings.			(c)	Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a decision regarding a removal permit has been made with regard to such controlled or decontrolled housing accommodation within the preceding twelve (12) months, the Board may, without holding a hearing, refuse to grant a removal permit for that housing accommodation or may dismiss any such application. In addition, if the application is not in conformance with the filing requirement of this section or applicable regulations, the Administrator may administratively dismiss such application without holding a hearing.	f.

Such provisions shall apply whether or not there is a license for such lodging house.

Such use shall not constitute a removal.	Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, lodging house units which are newly constructed or converted to lodging house use after the effective date of this subsection 1 and which have not been rented or offered for rent previously as lodging house units shall be exempt from the lodging house removal permit requirement. Said exemption shall have no effect on the operation of all other ordinances and regulations.	b.	Definitions. See definition for “Dormitory or Student Housing”, “Lodging House” and “Lodging House Unit” in subsections 10-2.1.	c.	Removal Permit Criteria. The Board, in determining whether to grant or deny a Removal/Conversion Permit shall consider the aggravation of the shortage of safe, decent and affordable rental housing units, especially lodging house units, in the City and its neighborhoods which may result from the removal/conversion, especially for low to moderate income, handicapped or elderly tenants.

	10-2.13A	Notice and Reasonable Opportunity to Purchase Units at the Time of Initial Conversion to Condominiums or Cooperatives.	a.	Notice of Planned Conversion. Where, on or after the date that this subsection is adopted by the City of Boston, a landlord converts or has the intent to convert a housing accommodation to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership, the landlord shall, prior to such conversion and/or the marketing of such condominium or cooperative units, give written notice of such conversion or planned conversion to the tenants residing in such housing accommodations, as well as notice to the Center. The notice shall describe the terms under which the tenants may purchase such property. The notice shall describe the price and the terms of any bona fide offer that the landlord would intend to accept for purchase of the housing accommodations. The Center shall provide information to such tenants of their rights under this section and of available local, State or Federal programs to assist in purchasing such accommodations.	If a tenant who is entitled to receive the notice of intent to convert as required herein vacates the residential unit before the initial sale and transfer of title to the residential unit as a condominium unit has occurred, then the landlord shall give each prospective tenant of the residential unit written notice, prior to the inception of the tenancy, which informs the prospective tenant that the unit is a condominium unit and, if applicable, that the unit is currently being offered for sale or will be offered for sale within ninety (90) days of the inception of the tenancy.	b.	Right of First Refusal on Initial Conversion/Sale of Housing Accommodations as Condominium or Cooperative Units. Individual tenants shall be given the right to purchase a housing accommodation which is converted or intended for conversion and sale as an individual condominium or cooperative unit on terms and conditions which are substantially the same as, or more favorable than, those which the owner extends to the public generally, or to a third party, whichever is less, for the ninety (90) days following the expiration of said tenant's right to purchase. Such tenant may exercise a right to purchase such housing accommodation by executing a purchase and sale agreement prior to the expiration of 
ninety (90) days after the date that the tenant receives a copy of the purchase and sale agreement properly executed by the person offering the housing accommodation for sale. No owner shall unreasonably refuse to enter into, or unreasonably delay the execution of, a purchase and sale agreement with a tenant entitled to a right of first refusal under this section that has made a bona fide offer to meet the price and substantially equivalent terms and conditions of an offer for which notice is required to be given pursuant to this subsection. Failure of the tenant entitled to exercise the right of first refusal to execute such a purchase and sale agreement within the ninety (90) day period shall serve to terminate the right of the tenant to purchase the housing accommodation, and there shall be no right of first refusal at the time of the subsequent sale of such unit; provided, however, the tenant shall still have the right of first refusal in the event of a condominium or cooperative conversion eviction as described in subsection 10-2.10f of this section. The time periods herein provided may be extended by agreement between the tenant and the landlord.	c.	Subsequent Notice and Opportunity to Purchase If Bona Fide Offer Changes. The right of first refusal created herein shall inure to a tenant for the time periods herein before provided. The effective period of such right of first refusal shall obtain separately for each substantially different bona fide offer to purchase the housing accommodation, and for each offer substantially equivalent to an offer made more than three (3) months prior to the later offer, provided, however, in the case of a substantially equivalent offer made by a prospective buyer who has previously made an offer which notice was required under subsection 10-2.13A of this section, the right of first refusal shall obtain only if such subsequent offer is made more than six (6) months after the earlier offer.	d.	Exemption to Right of First Refusal. The right of first refusal shall not apply with respect to any offer received by the owner for which notice is not required pursuant to subsection 10-2.13A of this section. No right of first refusal shall apply to a government taking by eminent domain or negotiated purchase, a force sale pursuant to a foreclosure, transfer by gift, devise, or operation of law, or a sale to a person who would be included within the table of

Should a housing accommodation which is subject to the provisions of this section also be subject to protections under other law, the tenant, landlord, or any city agency or authority shall be entitled to rely on all protections that may apply under applicable law.	b.	Conversion of Housing Accommodations After Rent Control Enabling Authority Ended. Where a housing accommodation was first converted to the condominium or cooperative conversion form of ownership after rent control enabling authority lapsed for such housing accommodation, and prior to the adoption of this section, and the landlord complied with the provisions of section 4 of chapter 527 of the acts of 1983, as amended, regarding notice to tenants of their rights and options with regard to condominium/cooperative conversion evictions, such action shall be deemed to be in compliance with this 
section, provided, however, any affected landlord shall notify the Center of such action and the names and addresses of all tenants given such notices within ninety (90) days of the enactment of this section.	c.

Such use has (a) contributed to the removal of residential housing from the market while a severe shortage exists; (b) contributed to the destruction and decay in affected residential neighborhoods; (c) created areas of the City where public order is difficult to enforce; and (d) deprived the City of needed tax revenues. In addition, 
this emergency cannot be dealt with solely by the operation of the private rental housing market nor by existing ordinances and unless the removal of residential units is additionally regulated and controlled, such emergency and the displacement resulting therefrom will produce serious threats to the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Boston. Furthermore, public regulation is necessary in order to provide residents with a sufficient supply of decent, affordable housing, to strengthen residential neighborhoods, to encourage public order and to preserve the City's tax base. Now, therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in it by law, including without limitation, Article 2, as amended, and Articles 47 and 89 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Chapter 797 of the Acts of 1969, as amended, Chapter 450 of the Acts of 1889, Chapter 355 of the Acts of 1960, Chapter 256 of the Acts of 1953, Chapter 22 of the Acts of 1949, Chapter 473 of the Acts of 1953 and Chapter 314 of the Acts of 1962 and M.G.L.

These students receive the benefit of their school's security or campus police services in addition to the City of Boston's police services. Because the schools know where their on-campus students live, the schools are better positioned to provide the security and regulation enforcement services necessary to protect students and property in these on-campus regions.	Many other students, however, live outside the campuses of their respective universities and colleges. When schools do not know where their off-campus students live, it is more difficult to assess and satisfy off-campus security and regulatory enforcement needs. Therefore, it is essential for schools within the City of Boston to collect and maintain records of the locally residing off-campus student population to
better assist the City of Boston in its provision of security and regulatory enforcement services for residents of the City of Boston.(Ord. 2004 c. 11)	10-10.2	Definitions.	Unless specifically indicated otherwise, these definitions shall apply and control in CBC 10-10.	a.
