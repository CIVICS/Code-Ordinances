The Collector-Treasurer shall annually furnish to each City department, board, commission or division, hereinafter referred to as the licensing authority, that issues licenses or permits, including renewals and transfers thereof, a list of any person, corporation, or business enterprise, hereinafter referred to as the party, that has neglected or refused to pay any local taxes, fees, assessments, betterments or other municipal charges for not less than a twelve (12) month period, and that has not filed in good faith a pending application for an abatement of such taxes or a pending petition before the Appellate Tax Board.	b.	The licensing authority may deny, revoke or suspend any license or permit, including renewals and transfers thereof, of any party whose name appears on said list furnished to the licensing authority from the Collector-Treasurer; provided, however, that written notice is given to the party and the Collector-Treasurer, as required by applicable provisions of law, and that the party is given a hearing by the licensing authority, to be held not earlier than fourteen (14) days after the licensing authority sends said 

notice by regular mail to the party. Said list shall be prima facie evidence for the denial, revocation or suspension of said license or permit to any party. The Collector-Treasurer shall have the right to intervene in any hearing conducted with respect to such license or permit denial, revocation or suspension. Any findings made by the licensing authority with respect to such license or permit denial, revocation or suspension shall be made only for the purposes of such proceeding and shall not be relevant to or introduced in any other proceeding at law, except for any appeal from such license or permit denial, revocation or suspension. Any license or permit denied, revoked or suspended under this section shall not be reissued, renewed or transferred until the licensing authority receives a certificate issued by the Collector-Treasurer that the party is in good standing with respect to any and all local taxes, fees, assessments, betterments or other municipal charges payable to the City as of the date of issuance of said certificate.	c.	Any party shall be given an opportunity to enter into a payment agreement with the Collector-Treasurer, thereby allowing the licensing authority to issue a certificate which indicates the conditions of the agreement upon which the license or permit is granted, and the validity of said license or permit shall be conditioned upon the satisfactory compliance with said agreement. Failure to comply with said agreement shall be grounds for the revocation or suspension of said license or permit; provided, however, that the party be given notice and a hearing as required by applicable provisions of law.	d.	The licensing authority may waive the denial, revocation or suspension of a license or permit to a party if he finds there is no direct or indirect business interest by the property owner, its officers or stockholders, if any, or members of his immediate family, as defined in G.L. c. 268A, § 1, in the business or activity conducted in or on said property.	1601

deposited into a revolving fund within the Animal Control Unit of the Property Management Department with disbursement at the direction of the Commissioner of Property Management, pursuant to the provisions of G.L. c. 44, §53E1/2, and shall be subject to annual authorization by the City Council with the approval of the Mayor. Said fund shall be utilized as follows: to reimburse for administrative costs to those City agencies which enforce this section and Chapter XVI of the City of Boston Ordinances, subsection 16-1.9 and for costs associated with licensing and registration. The total amount which may be expended from such fund in fiscal year 1997 shall not exceed amounts authorized under the aforesaid Section 53E1/2 of G.L. c. 140.(Ord. 1996 c. 8 § 2)	16-1.9E	Responsible Pit Bull Ownership.	16-1.9E.1	Purpose.	Dogs known as Pit Bulls have generally-exhibited traits such as (i) powerful instincts for dominance which naturally results in a proclivity for fighting; (ii) a strong prey drive, which, inspires a natural chase instinct that often results in their aggressive pursuit of cats, rabbits, other dogs, and human children; (iii) a stubbornness that results in sustained, unyielding aggressiveness once an attack begins; (iv) powerful jaws capable of crushing bones and hanging on to victims even while the animal withstands infliction of injury or pain; and (v) a combination of stamina, agility, strength, and “gameness” (the will to successfully complete a task). Judicial and legislative bodies have reacted by noting that the classification of Pit Bulls as dangerous animals has a rational basis in fact and that adopting controlling measures in order to reduce the likelihood of human injury bears a rational relationship to the governmental objective of preserving public health, public safety, and public welfare.	The City of Boston has experienced its share of violent Pit Bull attacks through numerous recent incidents, such as: in Hyde Park on March 24, 2003, a Pit Bull attacked another dog leading the owner to defend his dog, himself, and a nearby teenager with a fishing knife; in Dorchester on June 26, 2003, two Pit Bulls were involved in menacing a young boy, chasing
a Boston Police Officer, and lunging at and knocking down another Boston police Officer; the officers protected themselves with gunshots; in the South End in August 2003, a Pit Bull mauled and killed “Lucy,” the family dog (a Maltese) of Superintendent of Boston Public Schools Thomas Payzant while his wife, Ellen Payzant, was walking in the neighborhood; in Roxbury on September 24, 2003, a Pit Bull mauled a victim and rushed a Boston Police Officer who was forced to defend himself with multiple gunshots.	The Boston City Council believes it is necessary to encourage responsible Pit Bull ownership by regulating, subject to certain exceptions with certain restrictions, Pit Bulls in order to fulfill its primary mandate to protect human health, safety, and welfare within the City of Boston. The assemblage of a task force that includes the valuable insights of Boston’s dog owners is intended to assist the development and implementation of these sections while providing a forum to analyze and address the broad fundamental issues of dog and human co-existence in the City.(Ord. 2004 c. 4 § 1)	16-1.9E.2	Definitions.	Unless specifically indicated otherwise, these definitions shall apply and control in CBC 16-1.9E.	a.

By requiring a dog to be licensed, liability for a dog's actions can easily be established and owners are responsible for ensuring the safety of the pet and others. This is especially important given that M.G.L. chapter 140, section 155 imposes strict liability upon the owner or keeper of a dog that causes bodily harm or property damage. Pursuant to M.G.L. chapter 140, section 147A and in order to advance the purposes of dog owner accountability, the City has the power to further regulate dog licensing. It is the intent of this section to protect and preserve public health, safety and wellness by prohibiting the leasing of licensed dogs. The City has a duty to monitor and regulate dog ownership via licensure. Allowing a licensed dog to be rented would create instability and uncertainty regarding the care and treatment of the animal, presumably resulting in aggressive and vicious conduct towards the lessee and public.	The Animal Control Unit shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to enforce this subsection.(Ord. 2008 c. 6 § 2)	16-1.9F.2	Definitions.	As used in these sections, the following words shall, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, have the following meanings:
	Keepership means harboring an animal with an assumption of custody, management, and control of the animal.	Pet business means anyone engaged in a business licensed under chapter 129 of the general laws.	Pet shelter means a public animal control facility, or any facility which is operated by any organization or individual for the purpose of protecting animals from cruelty, neglect, or abuse.	Police dog means any dog owned by police departments or police agencies of the commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions when such dogs are under the direct supervision, care and control of a police officer.	Professional handler/trainer means any person engaged in the breeding, training, and/or showing of another's dog for either of the following purposes: (i) entering the dog in a show or exhibition, or (ii) employing the dog in the entertainment field.	Leasing/renting means offering, or entering into, an agreement by which an owner or keeper of a licensed dog receives a fee in exchange for conveying the temporary right of keepership of a licensed dog.	Leasing does not include the following: temporary conveyance of police dogs or service animals; temporary conveyance of a dog to a research institution licensed under section 174D of chapter 140 of the general laws for medical or scientific purposes; temporary conveyance of a dog to a veterinarian or entity licensed under section 55 of chapter 112 of the general law for medical purposes; temporary conveyance of a dog to a kennel licensed under section 137A of chapter 140 of the general laws for the purposes of breeding, boarding, sale, training, or hunting; conveyance of a dog by a pet business, as defined in section 1, with the intent to permanently transfer title of the dog at the time of conveyance; or temporary conveyance of a dog by a pet shelter for the purposes of animal foster care or adoptions services only; or temporary conveyance of a dog to a professional trainer/handler.

Simultaneously, the City of Boston has undertaken increased security measures, and the effectiveness of these security measures requires attentiveness from the Harbormaster and cooperation from the boating community. The boating community plays a unique and valuable role in self-policing itself and insisting on high community standards throughout the waterways, but the security of the Boston Harbor depends on the vigilance of the uniformed and civilian personnel of the Harbormaster.	The City expends considerable funds annually to provide an Office of the Harbormaster and Harbor

16-48	CITY OF BOSTON CODE - ORDINANCES	16-48
Patrol craft to enhance and protect public safety, public health, and the public welfare. Appropriately, other cities and towns along the Massachusetts coastline have collected user fees that at least partially defray the expense in providing a Harbormaster and a mooring program, and security, however critical it may be, is only a portion of the Harbormaster’s duties.	The City of Boston, in deference to the history of the recreational boating community and in order to encourage the recreational use of the Boston Harbor, has delayed its demand and collection of such user fees. In fact, Boston Harbor is among the last of the Massachusetts harbors to implement some form of municipal-level harbor-centered user fee. Increased boater population, augmented security requirements, and other amplified programmatic demands have combined to make it impossible for the Harbormaster to maintain a responsible and adequate level of service and attention to the boating community without administering a small annual fee to the recipients of the service and attention: boaters that moor or dock their boats in Boston Harbor.	Finally, the City will establish a Waterways Board comprised of persons and organizations with the knowledge and expertise to provide a public forum to ensure the most effective, safe, fair, and equitable use of the waterways.(Ord. 2004 c. 1 § 1)	16-48.2	Definitions.	Unless specifically indicated otherwise, these definitions shall apply and control in CBC 16-48.	a.

The policy recommendations of the Waterways Board shall be in writing and shall be filed with the City Clerk who shall forward them to the

The Mayor with the approval of the CityCouncil, may direct the Harbormaster to adopt or implement specific recommendations made by the Waterways Board, and, to the extent required, shall amend CBC to effect such recommendations. All meetings of the Waterways Board shall be open to the general public with opportunity for public participation.(Ord. 2004 c. 1 § 1)	16-48.16	Applicability.	If any provision of these sections imposes greater restrictions or obligations than those imposed by any other general law, special law, regulation, rule, ordinance, order, or policy then the provisions of these sections shall control.(Ord. 2004 c. 1 § 1)	16-48.17	Regulatory Authority.	In consultation with the Waterways Board, the Harbormaster shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement and enforce these sections.

	16-48.19	Implementation.	The provisions of these sections shall be effective immediately upon passage, but no fees may be charged until January 1, 2005 and no fines may be assessed until June 1, 2005.(Ord. 2004 c. 1 § 1)16-49	IDENTIFYING JACKETS FOR VALET PARKERS.	16-49.1	Purpose.	The Boston Transportation Department has established different parking regulations to divide the city’s limited parking among residential and commercial uses. Regulations on parking include the use of meters and the issuance of permits, such as the Residential Parking Permit and Valet Parking Permit. The Boston Transportation Department’s Traffic Rules and Regulations govern valet parking operations and the issuance of Valet Parking Permits, and Article IVA, Section 2 of these regulations require valet parking personnel to use only designated Valet Parking Zones for the discharge and receiving of passengers while Article IVA, Section 7.2 prohibits valet parking of a car in any space that is not in an approved off-street parking facility. These regulations seek to ensure that valet parking personnel do not park cars in spaces that would otherwise be available to visitors and residents in a neighborhood. City personnel face difficulty enforcing these provisions, however, because valet parking personnel are not easily distinguished from the public. Valet parking personnel are able to evade the restrictions and park illegally at meters, in Resident Parking spaces, and other inappropriate locations. Enhancing the means of enforcing these parking regulations will help ensure the proper use of on-street parking as delineated in the regulations of the Boston Transportation Department. If able to distinguish between valet parking personnel and the general public, the city personnel enforcing parking restrictions and Valet Parking Permits could more easily identify violations of these regulations.(Ord. 2004 c. 9)	16-49.2	Definitions.	Unless specifically indicated otherwise, these definitions shall apply and control in CBC 16-48.

Valet Parking Permit means a permit issued to a person, business, establishment or corporation pursuant to Article IVA of the Traffic Rules and Regulations of the Boston Transportation Department.(Ord. 2004 c. 9)	16-49.3	Prohibition.	No Valet Parking Operator who is engaged in providing valet services, including but not limited to receiving or discharging passengers or loading or unloading baggage from a vehicle, making arrangements to remove the vehicle to a designated off-street parking facility, parking a vehicle, or otherwise in control of a vehicle subject to valet parking requirements, may engage in such activities unless the Valet Parking Operator is wearing a jacket or shirt clearly marked “VALET” across the back in reflective lettering that shall be highly contrasting with the background/field/screen (i.e. dark-colored reflective lettering on light-colored background or light-colored reflective lettering on dark-colored background); each individual letter of the word “VALET” shall be no smaller than three inches (3") in height.

The Boston Police Department has instituted “Operation Party Time” and other programs as direct responses to these disturbances and acts of violence. These sections are intended to provide the authorities with some legislative tools including civil penalties and fines, to assist the Boston Police Department with its efforts to stop such parties in progress and prevent future occurrences of them to enhance the public safety of the City of Boston and to improve the quality of life in the neighborhoods of the City of Boston.(Ord. 2005 c. 5)
