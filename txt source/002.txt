The purpose of this section is to ensure that all City Councillors are fully reporting their relevant financial interests on a yearly basis. Such disclosures are in the interest of transparency and good governance and will help to prevent conflict of interest problems.(Ord. 2009 c. 2)2-14.2	Definitions.	Business shall mean any corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, firm, franchise, association, organization, holding company, joint stock company, receivership, business or real estate trust, or any other legal entity organized for profit or charitable purposes.	Business trust shall mean a business (or "Massachusetts") trust generally organized pursuant to M.G.L. c. 182, or some other similar statue, for the purpose of conducting a business. It is similar to a corporation in that its ownership interest is generally divided into transferable shares or certificates which are held by the beneficiaries. These beneficiaries are similar to a corporation's stockholders. See also Trust.
	Charitable trust shall mean a type of business trust, generally a not-for-profit entity organized for charitable trust purposes such as supporting certain educational, scientific or religious goals. The provisions of a charitable trust are usually enforceable by the Attorney General and such trusts are sometimes tax-exempt pursuant to IRC 501(c)(3).  See also Trust.	Debt shall mean loan or liability and all collateral associated therewith, excluding installment loans, educational loans, medical and dental bills, credit card purchases, support or alimony obligations, or debt owed in the ordinary course and day-to-day operations of running a business.	Direct interest in legislation, legislative action or a matter before the City Council shall mean when a person has an interest in, at any time during the relevant calendar year, (i) the use or value of his property; or (ii) the conduct of his business; or (iii) the use or value of the property of or the conduct of the business of a person with which he is affiliated as an employee, officer, director, trustee, general partner, proprietor, or in a similar managerial capacity, that could be or was affected by legislation, legislative action or a matter before the City Council, unless the effect is not substantially greater than the effect generally on persons residing in Massachusetts. Any business, which is regulated by the City Council has such an interest.	Equity shall mean any stock, partnership share, beneficial trust interest, proprietorship interest, or similar ownership interest in a business.	Fair market value shall mean the value that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for property in an arm's-length transaction.

A family trust may be created by a written document, but need not be. See also Trust. Depending on the nature of the trust, the beneficiary may have either a "present interest" (a right to trust assets now) or a "future interest" (for example, an interest that will not occur until someone's death). A
	212Rev. 3/5/10 Supp. 9	
2-14	FORM OF GOVERNMENT	2-14
"future interest" may be further classified as either "vested" or "contingent," meaning that the interest may or may not be certain to occur at some future point. Generally, if you have the right to receive any of the assets of the trust right now, you have a "present" interest in those assets. Accordingly, you would have to report ownership of those assets if valued at one thousand ($1,000.00) dollars or more. On the other hand, if you do not have the right to receive any of the assets of the trust right now, you do not have a "present" interest in those assets. Accordingly, you would not have to report anything about those assets.	Gifts are anything given when full value is not returned for what was received and may include payment, entertainment, subscription, advance, discount, or services having in the aggregate a fair market value in excess of one hundred ($100.00) dollars.  This does not include gifts from a spouse, immediate family or close family (parents, grandparents, children, siblings) member nor does it include political contribution which must be otherwise disclosed in accordance with relevant laws.	Honoraria mean a payment of money or anything of value as consideration for an appearance, speech, article or the like.	Income shall mean any income from whatever source derived including a fee, salary, allowance, forbearance, forgiveness, interest, dividend, royalty, rent, capital gain, or any other form of recompense or any combination thereof. Excluded only are the following:		1.	Interest from savings accounts and certificates of deposit;		2.	Interest from governmental obligations other than those of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision or any public agency or authority created by the state legislature; 		3.	Alimony and support payments;		4.	Proceeds from a life insurance policy;		5.	Interest or dividends from money market funds; retirement or disability benefits profit-sharing plans, 401 (k) plans; and		6.	Social security payments.
	Investment shall mean any tangible or intangible property, whether personal property or realty, held primarily for the purpose of attaining an economic advantage, whether directly (as in the case of income or appreciation) or indirectly (as in the case of tax shelters). Excluded from this definition are, for example, properties held chiefly for enjoyment, certain retirement plans, profit-sharing plans, 401(k) plans, insurance policies and your primary residence.	Legislative agent shall mean any person who for compensation or reward does any act to promote, oppose or influence legislation, or to promote or oppose or influence the governor's approval or veto thereof or to influence the decision of any member of the executive branch where such decision concerns legislation or the adoption, defeat, of postponement of a standard, rate, rule or regulation pursuant thereto. The term shall include persons who, as any part of their regular and usual employment and not simply incidental thereto, attempt to promote, oppose or influence legislation or the governor's approval or veto thereof, whether or not any compensation in addition to the salary for such employment is received for such services.	Person shall mean a business, individual, corporation, union, association, firm, partnership, committee or other organization or groups of persons.	Realty trust shall mean a type of business trust generally organized for the primary purpose of buying, selling, holding, or investing real property usually created by a written instrument.

See also Trust.	Reimbursement is a payment for money expended or to be expended (for example, travel, meals, or lodging), which is for actual expenses incurred or to be incurred reasonably related to the event to which they are connected.	Security shall mean any note, stock, bond, debenture, evidence of a debt owed to you or to your spouse, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing arrangement, certificate of interest in any mutual fund, stock, or commodity option, or similar evidence of ownership or interest, or a receipt or certificate of deposit for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.

	Tax shelter shall mean any device used by taxpayer to reduce or to defer payment of taxes. Tax shelters organized either as a business or as an investment and are reportable on Statements of Financial Interests as such. Retirement plans are not considered tax shelters and are generally not reportable.	Trust shall mean a legal entity in which the actual (or "beneficial") ownership of property is separated from its legal ownership. The legal ownership is held by a trustee who owes certain duties to the beneficiaries. Those duties usually arise by a written document (a "Declaration of Trust," for example).(Ord. 2009 c. 2)	2-14.3	Statement of Financial Interests.	All City Councillors must file an annual Statement of Financial Interests with the City Clerk on or before June 1 of each calendar year for the preceding calendar year.
